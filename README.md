# GameJam9-SelfCARE
Game created for the GUDEV Game Jam 9

SelfCARE is a puzzle game where the player needs to connect the matching shapes. The game has a simple goal, and is designed to be calm and relaxing. <br>
You can play the game [on this itch.io page](https://frettini.itch.io/selfcare). <br>
You can see a demo of the game [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuW7qreqLu0&t=328s&ab_channel=5MGChannel). <br>
The soundtrack (not included in the repo) can be found [at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4lK-FKe1Fs&ab_channel=NicolaeMarton). <br>

The game was built using the Unity engine. The implementation is simple. The main features are the following:
* Level Generator script for fast level creation.
* Control and Logic script.
* Level Manager for event handling.

This game was done as part of a game jam and I will likely not have the time to work on it in the near future. <br>
However here are a few directions I might want to take this project:
* Add mobile support.
* Refactorization of level generation (some decoupling to do).
* Create a Level Editor tool.
* generate many more levels!
